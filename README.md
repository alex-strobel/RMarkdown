 R Markdown Course

This project is intended to be a course to learn RMarkdown. It contains a number of RMarkdown lessons (located in the _Lessons_ folder), each ending with some exercises. Anyone taking this course should try to come up with solutions to the exercises before sneaking into the _Solutions_ folder.
